directory for project: home dir -> server -> public
server -- contains server.js
public -- contains static files: html, css, and js files for browser
     server automatically serves any file in public

why is it bad to have files in server dir, not public dir
- a user would be able to access your server code, we don't want them to see

create a table in DB -- 'CREATE TABLE Flashcards (user INT, input TEXT,
                           response TEXT, num_seen INT, num_correct INT)'
can delete a table in DB -- 'DROP TABLE flashcards'

never past user input into SQL command -- might have malicious text
- similar to why we don't use 'innerHTML'
this is called SANITIZATION

Santizing inputs -- send to server
INSERT into Flashcards(user, english, korean, seen,
             correct) VALUES(1, @0, @1, 0, 0)
^ checks that values supplied for the params have correct type (@0, @1)
Should check in code to make sure input is not too long

Code:
const cmdStr = 'INSERT into Flashcards(user,english,korean,seen,correct)
                         VALUES(1,@0,@1,0,0)'
db.run(cmdStr, eng, kor, insertCallback);

function insertCallback(err){
   if(err){ console.log(err); }
   else{ console.log("Successfully stored flashcard") }
}

How to access elements in table
'SELECT * FROM Flashcards' -- whole table
'SELECT columns FROM table WHERE Boolean'
WHERE:
WHERE seen < 3
WHERE seen < 3 and correct < 1
WHERE googleid = 587302830 -- when we implement userid/passwords

db.get('SELECT * FROM Flashcards WHERE user = 1', arrayCallback);

function arrayCallback(err, arrayData){
   if(err){ console.log("error:",err, "\n"); }
   else{ console.log("array:", arrayData, "\n"); }
}
arrayData -- contains an array of objects, each object contains one row

Changing a row
'UPDATE Flashcards SET seen = 1 WHERE rowid = 73'
WARNING: omitting WHERE changes all the slected column in all rows
use = not == in both SET and WHERE

if u call db.run() and then db.get(), might not output correct values
- depends if the update finished before the db.get() command -- asynchronous
