Notes from lecture 5/10 on Databases

When user hits enter, asking for the translation
browser sends AJAX req with English
server sends HTTP req with English to Cloud Translate API, waits for res
When API comes back, server sends res to the browser

browser sends AJAX request when press 'save'
in AJAX -- includes english and spanish to be saved in DB
server communicates with DB to save the flashcard in the table
database confirms data is stored, tells server it worked, server tells
   browser that it worked

Databases -- used for large amounts of data
data is retrieved by an index, not just reading through the entire file
   index -- can be alphabetical, hash table, etc.

SQLite -- not really for huge amounts of data, good for this project
sqlite3 -- Node module interfacting to SQLite
SQLite -- saves data in a single file in server directory. Uses its own
   file access techniques to minimize time to find an element

SQL -- declarative language: specify what you want, not the computations the
   database should use to do it
made of tables -- similar to a spreadsheet

Database set up -- set up ONCE, before server runs. -- not part of server
Data in file that we set up remains on disk, even when server is off

Every SQL command to db, must specify callback function even if no response
   to check for errors, or lack there of
Why not just wait for command to return?
   -might take a long time - bad b/c browser is constantly sending http req
